# React Solo Project - Travel Journal

This project was apart of the Scrimba Learn React course. The objective of this project specifically was to create a practice basic React principles including but not limited to reusable components, props, mapping, and arrays. The course provided the data (pictures, text, guideline for layout) used to create the Travel Journal but the Journal itself was completely self-made.
